How to use this project:

The resources/scripts directory of this project is full of small,
simple steering files that you should run in order (pass1, pass2,
pass3, etc.)  Each attempts to demonstrate, as simply as possible, a
different aspect of the business of writing icetray modules.

Each script has comments in it, and some reference small, simply coded
I3Modules that are in this project.  The header files are in public/
and the implementation files are in private/.

Let us know if this is helpful...

How not to use this project:

Don't dump scripts here that have lots of unused code in them,
outdated comments, references to local data, or that don't demonstrate
some particular aspect of the system clearly.  Don't commit sloppy
code to this project.  This project is NOT a sandbox: it is
documentation.  Documentation that you can run, copy, and hack.
